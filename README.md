## Changes

The `v2` and `v1` are totally different:

- `v2` built on top of `net/http`.
 
- `v2` require `go1.8` or above.

- `v2` is compatible with `Windows`.


## FAQ

- Why choose `net/http` instead of `fasthttp`?

    1. `net/http` has much more third-party packages than `fasthttp`.
    
    2. `fasthttp` doesn't support `HTTP/2` yet.

**Inspiration & Credits**

For respecting the third party packages, I added their author into [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md), and listed those packages here.

    Gem's router is a custom version of `httprouter`, thanks to `httprouter`.
