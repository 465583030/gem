Gem, a simple and fast web framework written in Go(golang), it built on top of [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp).

**Note** it is currently incompatible with `Windows`, see [#8](https://github.com/go-gem/gem/issues/8), apologize for the inconvenience.

Um, Gem is quite new package, so it's APIs is currently unstable until the `v1.0.0` being released,
see [milestones](https://github.com/go-gem/gem/milestones) for details,
and if you are interest in this project, you can star it, all of suggestions and PRs are welcome.

waiting for rerunning the benchmark.


## Quick Start

More usages may be obtained in [Wiki](#wiki).

```
package main

import (
    "log"
    
    "github.com/go-gem/gem"
)

func main() {
    router := gem.NewRouter()
    router.GET("/", func(ctx *gem.Context) {
        ctx.HTML(200, "Hello world.")
    })

	log.Fatal(gem.ListenAndServe(":8080", router.Handler()))
}
```

Run the code above, and then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
